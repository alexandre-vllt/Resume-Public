# My projects 

description : here is some project I ve done during my double degree at CentraleSupelec in general engineering

## Project 1 : A 2D platformer built with Python

This project is a side-scrolling 2D platformer inspired by classic games like Super Mario. Built with Python and Pygame, it features a playable character that moves, jumps, and explores levels filled with obstacles and enemies.

The game includes gravity and collision mechanics, sprite animations, and level progression. The code is organized around object-oriented design, making it modular and easy to extend.

This game was developed during Coding Week at CentraleSupélec, a one-week event dedicated to creating a group programming project from scratch.


## Project 2 : Stock Market Nonlinear Dynamics Modeling

This project explores the nonlinear evolution of stock market prices through a discrete-time dynamical system inspired by Bischi & Valori’s model. Using Python simulations, we developed and analyzed a model that couples the interaction between price (P) and investor savings (S) while integrating nonlinear terms and random external events to better mimic real market behaviors. The study includes stability analysis, simulation of equilibrium points, and the creation of a hybrid automaton to capture sudden market shifts. This work demonstrates how nonlinearity and randomness can explain the complex oscillations and volatility observed in real financial markets.

## Project 3 : High-Performance Task Scheduling Optimization (ST7 – ANEO Project)

This project focuses on optimizing the scheduling of task graphs for high-performance computing (HPC) environments using the HLFET (Highest Level First with Estimated Times) heuristic. Implemented in Python, the algorithm was designed to minimize the total execution time (makespan) of complex dependency graphs while maintaining computational efficiency.

After a theoretical study and problem formalization, the algorithm was implemented locally and then deployed on AWS Lambda to evaluate scalability and performance on large-scale DAGs (up to 100,000 tasks). The results showed that HLFET consistently outperforms greedy approaches in execution efficiency, achieving near-linear scalability in cloud environments.

## Project 4 : Nonparametric and Linear Regression Analysis

This project explores statistical modeling and regression techniques using Python, focusing on both linear and nonparametric regression methods. The work aims to compare the predictive performance, interpretability, and flexibility of models when applied to real or simulated datasets.

The Linear Regression module introduces classical parametric estimation, exploring coefficient significance and residual analysis. The Nonparametric Regression study (kernel and local polynomial approaches) highlights how relaxing linearity assumptions allows for more adaptable models that capture complex relationships in data.
